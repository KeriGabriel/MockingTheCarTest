You will be testing the vehicle's ability
to start. To do that you will mock the engine
for the Vehicle to use in your (as yet to
be added) MSTest test project.

For the test project: MSTest
For mocking: Moq

Considerations:
-class accessability level
-methods accessability level, virtual
-What are you testing and what are you not testing?
-What changes - if anything - using enums?
